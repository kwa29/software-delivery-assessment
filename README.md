# Multi-team Software Delivery Assessment

The Multi-team Software Delivery Assessment is a simple, easy-to-execute approach to assessing software delivery across many different teams within an organisation. Devised by [Matthew Skelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) of [Conflux](https://confluxdigital.net/), it is used as a key part of the [Software Delivery Assessment at Conflux](https://confluxdigital.net/), but can be used freely by anyone (subject to the CC BY-SA license below).

The assessment uses and builds on the well-known and proven [Spotify Squad Health Check model](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/). 

> Translations: [Japanese (ja 🇯🇵)](translations/ja/README.ja.md)

The assessment covers eight dimensions in total: 

1. [Team Health](team-health.md)
2. [Deployment](deployment.md)
3. [Flow](flow.md)
4. [Continuous Delivery](continuous-delivery.md)
5. [Operability](operability.md)
6. [Testing and Testability](testability.md)
7. [Reliability and SRE](reliability.md)
8. [On-call](on-call.md)

These eight dimensions cover key aspects of modern software delivery in a form that enables teams to self-assess their strengths and practices.

**🚀 Overview**: see slides 32-38 in [Continuous Delivery at scale](https://www.slideshare.net/matthewskelton/continuous-delivery-at-scale-matthew-skelton-nhs-digital-agile-cop-march-2019)

**🃏 Card deck**: make the assessment fun and interactive by using [the 66-card Software Delivery Assessment printed card deck from Agile Stationery](https://agilestationery.co.uk/pages/software-delivery-assessment). Developed in collaboration with Conflux, the card deck has _Tired_ and _Inspired_ indicators for each of the assessment criteria, together with emoji cards for quick-fire voting from team members. The card deck works for remote assessments too!
